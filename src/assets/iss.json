			"comment": "incredible all-around. Use to set assisting Wild dice to V+V side and make any checks easy and reliable with no RNG. STUFF TWO OF THOSE RECRUITS IN RECON FIRST. Fairly early during campaign Recons get an Equipment that let other Crew assist Recon remotely from other Sectors. Recon Alphas never have a shortage of helpers! Uwe Lehmann (Alpha, Compass conversion) is a prime candidate for a Recon Section R3 operative."

			"ability": "pull a personal or small Equipment from Armory",
			"comment": "there is a lot of pretty busted personal Equipment available later in the game. Most value is Security Section, since they get the best consumable Equipment that heals injuries, manipulates timetracks, refreshes dice etc. Engineers have a single lategame busted consumable Equip as well, and there always are decent Neutral options, so you can never have too many Loaders in your team. I wouldn't recommend these in Recon, since Recon Equipment tends to have powerful passive effects rather than be consumables."

			"comment": "a great 'Payload' ability that lets you obtain way, way more discoveries than you normally would, since you can convert triple zero leads into something useful. Combine with Pod Launcher to bypass Lander Discovery limit and you're set for juicy milkruns. You can still make Searcher work even in tough story missions if you use Science cards that convert excess Discoveries into Supplies."

			"charges": 3,
			"ability": "Ignore the result of Danger die",
			"comment": "Danger dice are the thing that makes you lose people and force Evacs. Alert crewmembers can take much more risks and reap those rewards where you wouldn't dare to roll Danger die otherwise. Do note that you roll the dice first, then decide whether to ignore the result or not! So the ability is not wasted on blank Danger die rolls."

			"ability": "Discard freshly drawn Event without any consequences",
			"comment": "Advanced Events are another key potential loss condition (especially the nasty ones that force you to lose Equipment), and this lets you discard them without even advancing Time Tracks! Very useful, especially if you employ Early Warning System to let Forecast character handle the worst events."

			"ability": "Turn ! dice to V side",
			"comment": "a weaker yet version of Adaptive / Alpha. It's still decent with Wild dice specifically, but by AR ruling you are not allowed to turn the die to V+V side which makes the overall ability way worse than Alpha or Adaptive which allow you to get V+V from Wild."

			"comment": "lets you cheat some consumable R3 cards several times per Mission. Obviously is as good as is the consumable card it pulls out. Best candidate hands down is Engineering's Tireless that lets you pull an extra Mission Equipment from the Armory, but in lategame even this usage is decidedly overshadowed by Loader."

			"ability": "When Assisting commit any number of Dice to Roll Pool, then Refresh all committed dice",
			"comment": "A turbocharged Dice Check is pretty decent even if it's only once per mission. Unfortunately for Selfless, there just are not that many long and tough progress tracks when you would want to throw 10 dice in the Pool to solve it in one go. It still is pretty great when it meets those, and they tend to become more frequent later in the game. It's probably the only 'B+' tier ability on the list."

The main argument against those is actually Alpha; Alpha lets you conserve a lot of dice and actions by passing tough Dice Checks without excessive resource commitment due to how RNG-independent Alpha is. If I had to pick one of those Crew for Away Team, I'd go with Fortitude since it' the most flexible and lets you recycle your best dice as necessary."
